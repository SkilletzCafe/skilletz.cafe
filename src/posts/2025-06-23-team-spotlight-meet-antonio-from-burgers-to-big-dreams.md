# Team Spotlight: Meet Antonio - From Burgers to Big Dreams

At Skillet'z, we believe in good food, great people, and stories worth sharing. Today, we're introducing you to someone who brings all three to the table‚Äî**Antonio Arroyo**, one of our amazing team members and someone you'll definitely want to root for.

Antonio is currently a student at [**Ohlone College**](https://www.ohlone.edu/), where he's laying the foundation for a future he's determined to build‚Äîone that includes getting into his dream school: [**Harvard**](https://www.harvard.edu/).

> "My goal is to one day run my own private equity firm," Antonio shares. "Not just for the business side of things‚Äîbut because I genuinely love helping people."

That heart for impact is part of what brought him to **Skillet'z**, where he now works as our **Business Development Intern**. And it's a perfect fit‚Äîbecause the values he stands for align perfectly with what we're all about.

> "Skillet'z is a place that values people, service, and quality‚Äîthings I care deeply about. I see this as an opportunity to put in the reps now, make a difference on a small scale, and take those lessons with me to create impact on a much bigger stage one day."

Antonio's journey with Skillet'z actually began before he joined the team. One of his favorite memories was when he came in as a guest‚Äîwith his girlfriend and her dad.

> "She ordered the iced coffee," he says, "and when it came out, it looked so good‚Äîlike it belonged in a TV commercial."

That moment stuck with him. Now, he's behind the scenes, helping create those same "wow" moments for others.

When asked about his favorite dish at Skillet'z? His answer is refreshingly simple:

**"Just a burger."**

A reminder that sometimes the best things in life are the classics‚Äîdone right.

He also had one more Skillet'z surprise:

> "I didn't even know there was a back patio until I started working here!"

![Did you know we have a back patio? Antonio didn't either ‚Äì until he joined the team!](/images/blog/meet-antonio-arroyo/4.png)

(Yes‚Äîwe have a sunny back patio, and it's perfect for your next visit.)

So next time you stop by, say hello to Antonio. You'll leave with more than a good meal‚Äîyou might just leave inspired.
