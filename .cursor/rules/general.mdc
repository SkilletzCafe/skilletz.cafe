# General Rules for Cursor

- Project is a website built with NextJS
- Website will be hosted on GitHub using NextJS static export
- Programming language: Typescript
- Keep structure/code and data separate. Use `src/config/site.ts` to store and maintain constants, URLs, and other similar data.
- All links away from the website domain should use `target="_blank"`

## Related Rule Files
- Glob: `*.mdc`
- All rule files MUST live inside `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/*`
- Learnings rules: `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/learnings.mdc`

## Git Hygiene and Housekeeping
- PR Template: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- Diff: .github/meta/diff.txt
- Commit Message: .github/meta/commit.txt
- Style:
  - Follow a hybrid of both gitmoji (https://gitmoji.dev/) and Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  - Use backticks for code blocks and referencing symbols
- Instructions:
  - When requested, create a commit message in the commit message file using context from the diff file following the format of the PR template
  - Brevity and conciseness should be prioritized
