# Project Learnings Rules

name: project_learnings
description: Rules for documenting and leveraging project learnings to improve AI assistance

## Purpose
- Document discoveries and insights that help the AI better understand the codebase.
- Build up a "stdlib" of knowledge that improves AI accuracy over time.
- Capture successful patterns and prevent repeated mistakes.

## When to Update
- After successfully resolving an AI misunderstanding.
- When discovering non-obvious implementation details.
- When finding undocumented dependencies or behaviors.
- When establishing new patterns or conventions.
- When correcting AI-generated code that didn't match project standards.
- After teaching the AI about project-specific requirements.

## Format
Each learning should be structured as:

```
markdown

Category: Brief Title
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Context:
- What was the situation/problem
- What did the AI initially get wrong (if applicable)

Learning:
- The key insight or pattern to remember
- The correct approach to use

Example:
// Example of correct implementation

Tags: #category #subcategory
```

## Categories
- architecture
- patterns
- conventions
- dependencies
- performance
- testing
- deployment
- security
- other project-specific categories

## Integration
- All learnings should be written in a way that helps the AI make better decisions
- Include specific code examples where relevant
- Reference related files and patterns
- Tag entries for better context matching
