# Menu System Architecture

## Overview
The menu system processes raw Toast POS data into an optimized format for the website, handling menu items, categories, and images.

## Data Flow
1. Raw Toast Menu Data (`src/data/menu/raw/toast-menu.json`)
   - Contains complete menu structure from Toast POS
   - Includes item details, prices, descriptions, and image links
   - Organized by menus → groups → items

2. Processing Script (`src/scripts/menu/process-menu.ts`)
   - Transforms raw Toast data into optimized website format
   - Filters items based on `orderableOnline` and `visibility`
   - Preserves direct image URLs from Toast
   - Run via `npm run menu:process`

3. Processed Menu Data (`src/data/menu/processed/menu.json`)
   - Simplified, flattened structure
   - Only includes necessary fields
   - Direct image URLs from Toast

## Data Structures

### Raw Toast Data
```typescript
interface ToastMenuItem {
  name: string;
  guid: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  imageLink: string | null;
  orderableOnline: string;
  visibility: string;
}

interface ToastData {
  menus: ToastMenu[];
  premodifierGroups: unknown[];
}
```

### Processed Menu Data
```typescript
interface ProcessedMenuItem {
  name: string;
  guid: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  imageUrl: string | null;
}

interface ProcessedData {
  menus: ProcessedMenu[];
}
```

## Frontend Implementation (`src/pages/menu.tsx`)
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- Lazy loading of images with placeholders
- Keyboard navigation support
- Category-based filtering
- Intersection Observer for performance
- Accessibility features

### Key Features
1. Image Handling
   - Uses Next.js Image component
   - Lazy loading with priority for first 4 items
   - Placeholder during loading
   - Fallback for missing images

2. Navigation
   - Horizontal scrolling category nav
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Smooth scrolling

3. Performance
   - Intersection Observer for visibility tracking
   - Staggered animations based on visibility
   - Optimized image loading

4. Accessibility
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Semantic HTML structure

## Best Practices
1. Data Processing
   - Keep processing logic separate from display logic
   - Filter out non-orderable items during processing
   - Maintain clear type definitions

2. Image Handling
   - Use direct image URLs from Toast
   - Provide fallbacks for missing images
   - Optimize loading performance

3. User Experience
   - Mobile-first design
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Accessible navigation

## Recent Learnings

### Menu Data Processing
Category: Data Management
Date: 2024-03-26
Context:
- Needed to simplify menu data processing
- Previous system used separate image mapping
- Toast provides direct image URLs

Learning:
- Use Toast's image URLs directly
- Remove unnecessary image mapping system
- Simplify data processing pipeline
- Maintain clear separation between raw and processed data

### Image Loading Strategy
Category: Performance
Date: 2024-03-26
Context:
- Menu items need images
- Images can be slow to load
- Need to handle missing images

Learning:
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Implement loading placeholders
- Prioritize first 4 items
- Clear fallback for missing images

### TV Display Feature
Category: User Experience
Date: 2024-03-27
Context:
- Need to showcase featured menu items in a TV display format
- Images need to transition smoothly
- Display needs to be configurable in real-time
- Screen needs to stay awake
- Display runs on Raspberry Pi in kiosk mode

Learning:
- Implement configurable transition delays (3-30 seconds)
- Use keyboard shortcuts for real-time control:
  - Left/Right arrows for manual navigation
  - +/- keys for adjusting transition speed
- Use Wake Lock API to prevent screen sleep
- Maintain consistent transition animations with CSS
- Use clear naming conventions for timing constants (e.g., `*_MILLIS` suffix)
- Separate client-side menu utilities from server-side data loading
- Shuffle featured items on client-side for variety
- Auto-reload page every 30 minutes for fresh content
- Hide cursor for kiosk mode display
- Use client-side state for shuffled items to maintain order during session
