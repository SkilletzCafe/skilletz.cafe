# General Rules for Cursor

## Project Overview
- Built with NextJS
- Static export for GitHub Pages hosting
- Programming language: TypeScript
- Mobile-first development approach

## Code Organization
- Keep structure/code and data separate
- Store constants, URLs, and configuration in `src/config/site.ts`
- All external links must use `target="_blank"`

## Code Style & Patterns
- Never reuse variables, classes, or styles that appear similar but serve different semantic purposes
  - Example: Don't reuse `imageContainer` from menu items for profile pictures
  - Example: Don't reuse `card` styles between menu items and blog posts
  - Instead: Create semantic variants like `menuItemImage`, `profileImage`, `menuCard`, `blogCard`
- Add meaningful comments for non-obvious code decisions
  - Example: Explain CSS hacks or workarounds
  - Example: Document approach selection rationale

## Testing Guidelines
- Write tests for all new components and features
- Test mobile responsiveness at breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px
  - Tablet: 768px
  - Desktop: 1024px
- Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Verify color contrast for accessibility compliance

## File Structure
- Rule files live in `.cursor/rules/`
  - Source files: `*.mdc` (version controlled)
  - Working copies: `*.mdc.txt` (for editing)
  - Specialized rule files:
    - `general.mdc`: Core project rules and structure
    - `ide.mdc`: IDE and project configuration settings
    - `javascript.mdc`: JavaScript and TypeScript development patterns
    - `learnings.mdc`: Project-specific insights and patterns
    - `mobile.mdc`: Mobile-first development guidelines
    - `typography.mdc`: Font families, usage, and best practices
- Use `make init-rules` to create working copies for editing
- Use `make save-rules` to save changes back to source files

## Git Workflow
- PR Template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Diff: `.github/meta/diff.txt`
- Commit Message: `.github/meta/commit.txt`
- Style:
  - Combine gitmoji (https://gitmoji.dev/) with Conventional Commits
  - Use backticks for code references
  - Keep messages concise and descriptive
